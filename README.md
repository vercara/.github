# `.github`

Welcome to the `.github` repository of Vercara! This special repository holds all the default community health files and resources for our GitHub organization.

## Purpose of This Repository

The `.github` repository is used to store default files that will be used for any public repository within our organization that does not contain its own version of those files. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Community Profile Files**: Issue templates, pull request templates, contributing guidelines, and code of conduct.
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Shared workflows that can be used across multiple projects within our organization.
- **GitHub Organization Profile**: The `profile/README.md` that appears on the organization's GitHub public profile page.

## Contributing

If you are part of our team and want to propose changes or additions to the files in this repository, please submit a pull request with a clear description of what you are modifying and why. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback on our policies and any files contained in this repository. If you have suggestions on how we can improve, please open an issue to discuss your ideas.

Thank you for helping us improve and refine our GitHub presence!
